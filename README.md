# [patn.dev](https://github.com/goodeats/patn.dev)

My portfolio website as a web developer.

## Development

To run this project locally:

```sh
cp .env.example .env # and fill in the values for ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD
npm i
npm run setup
npm run dev
```

## Notes

This project is built with [Remix Run](https://remix.run/) and was started using the [Epic Stack](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack), graciously provided by [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds).

I am a big fan of Remix Run as a web framework for building better websites.
