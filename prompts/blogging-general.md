## Markdown Formatting Guidelines

### Basic Formatting

1. **Headers**
   - Use `#` for main titles (H1)
   - Use `##` for sections (H2)
   - Use `###` for subsections (H3)
   - Leave one blank line before and after headers

2. **Lists**
   - Use `-` for unordered lists
   - Use `1.` for ordered lists
   - Indent nested lists with 2 spaces
   - Leave one blank line before and after lists

3. **Emphasis**
   - Use `**text**` for bold
   - Use `*text*` for italics
   - Use `***text***` for bold italics
   - Use `` `code` `` for inline code

### Code Blocks

1. **Fenced Code Blocks**
   - Use triple backticks (```)
   - Specify language after opening backticks
   - Leave one blank line before and after code blocks

   ```javascript
   function example() {
     return 'properly formatted';
   }
   ```

2. **Links and References**
   - Use `[text](url)` for inline links
   - Use `[text][reference]` with `[reference]: url` for reference-style links
   - Group references at the bottom of the document

### Document Structure

1. **Spacing**
   - Single blank line between paragraphs
   - Single blank line before and after lists
   - Single blank line before and after code blocks
   - No trailing whitespace at line ends

2. **Line Length**
   - Aim for 80 characters per line maximum
   - Break long lines at natural points
   - Use soft wrapping for paragraphs

3. **Consistency**
   - Use consistent spacing for similar elements
   - Maintain consistent list marker styles
   - Keep heading hierarchy logical (don't skip levels)

### Best Practices

1. **Front Matter**
   - Use YAML front matter when needed
   - Include metadata like title, date, author
   - Separate from content with `---`

2. **Tables**
   - Align table pipes vertically
   - Use header separators
   - Example:
   | Header 1 | Header 2 |
   |----------|----------|
   | Cell 1   | Cell 2   |

3. **Images**
   - Include alt text: `![alt text](image.jpg)`
   - Use relative paths when possible
   - Group image references at bottom
