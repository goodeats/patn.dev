# Docs

This directory contains documentation for the project. I intend for this to be a helpful resource for you, myself, and my LLM friends ðŸ¤–.

The project is in active development, so the documentation may be be likely to change or be out of date.



## Pages

- [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md) - How to get started with the project.
- [Decisions](./decisions/README.md) - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the project.
